# Welcome to one of my personal repo for learning React.js

This project repo is my personal note from learning one of Brad Traversy's course on udemy, you can checkout the course through this link (<https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022>)

I have learn many things from the course, like:

## 01-Feedback-UI

In this section I learn how to built feedback app, by submiting feedback form that send review text and rating, also I learn how to use framer-motion, create form validation, making defaultProps, and validating props type by using (import PropTypes from 'prop-types')
